\section{Noise free benchmark BBOB functions}

The noise free benchmark BBOB functions~\cite{hansen2010real} are a selected group of functions that are often used to evaluate the performance of evolutionary computation algorithms.


These functions can be separated in two groups by their complexity. The first group is composed on unimodal functions while the second group is composed on multimodal functions. Here we consider that unimodal functions are functions with only one local optimum (equal to the global optimum) while multimodal functions are functions that have many local optimum (with one of them being the global optimum). 

The unimodal functions used here are: Sphere Function, Ellipsoidal Function (F2), Linear Slope, Atractive Sector Function, Step Ellipsoidal Function, Rosenbrock Function - original, Rosenbrock Function - rotated, Ellipsoidal Function (F10), Discus Function, Bent Cigar Function, Sharp Ridge Function, and Different Powers Function.

While the multimodal functions used here are: Rastrigin Function (F3), Buche-Rastring Function, Rastring Function (F15), Weierstrass Function, Schaffers F7 Function, Schaffers F7 Function moderately ill-conditioned, Composite Griewank-Rosenbrock Function F8F2, Schwefel Function, Gallagher's Gaussian 101-me Peaks Function, Gallagher's Gaussian 21-hi Peaks Function, Katsuura Function, and Lunacek bi-Rastrigin Function.
